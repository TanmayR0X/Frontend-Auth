### 🔐 Frontend Authentication System (Login & Signup)

A pure frontend authentication system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to sign up, log in, maintain sessions using localStorage, and access a protected dashboard with session expiry logic.

This project simulates real-world authentication flow without backend integration and is ideal for learning client-side auth concepts.
